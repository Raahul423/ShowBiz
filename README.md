after deploy  my project in vercel app from github then i want to update my code and push to github then vercel automatic take upfated code ?? if not then tell how we can do this 


ChatGPT said:
Yes, Vercel automatically updates your deployed app when you push changes to the connected GitHub repository — if it's set up correctly.

✅ How It Works (If Set Up Properly)
When you:

Make changes to your code locally,

Push to the GitHub repo (usually to the main or master branch),

👉 Vercel will detect the change, pull the updated code, and automatically redeploy your app.

✅ Make Sure It Works Like This:
To ensure this works smoothly:

Check that your Vercel project is linked to your GitHub repository:

Go to vercel.com/dashboard

Open your project

Under Settings > Git, confirm it's connected to your GitHub repo.

Push to a connected branch:

Vercel deploys the main branch (or the one you selected during setup) by default.

Use git push origin main (or your branch name) to push your updates.

✅ Optional: Enable Preview Deployments
If you're using multiple branches (e.g. feature-x, dev), Vercel can create preview deployments for each one — helpful for testing before merging.

❌ If It's Not Updating Automatically
If it's not auto-deploying:

Double-check that GitHub is connected.

Go to Project Settings > Git, and reconnect if needed.

Make sure you're pushing to the correct branch.

You can also manually trigger a deployment from the Vercel dashboard.

💡 TL;DR:
Yes, Vercel will automatically redeploy when you push to the connected GitHub branch. Just push and Vercel takes care of the rest. ✅

Let me know if you want help setting up this connection or troubleshooting!

Great question!

This line in the README.md:

(Add screenshots of homepage, movie details, seat layout, login screen, etc. in the assets/ folder and embed here)

means:

🖼️ You should:
Take screenshots of key parts of your app like:

Homepage

Movie details page

Seat layout/booking interface

Login/signup screen

Save those images in a folder inside your project named assets (you can create it in your root directory if it doesn't exist yet):
